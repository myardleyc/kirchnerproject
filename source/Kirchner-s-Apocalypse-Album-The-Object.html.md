The Getty Research Institute's album by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, which contains eleven miniature drawings of sequences from the Apocalypse, is exceptional in the German artist's oeuvre. This is not only the case with regards to its topic - the Biblical story of Revelation - as religious narratives and scenes are almost entirely absent from Kirchner's work. The only exception is the period of the First World War, when the artist, like many of his contemporaries, turned to established religious narratives such as the Apocalypse, to convey his feelings.In addition to the Apocalypse, Kirchner also illustrated Peter Schlemihl's Wondrous Story in 1915, the biblical narrative of Absalom and Petrarca's Triumph of Love in 1918 However, it is also the album itself, which stands out from the entirety of Kirchner's large body of sketchbooks and drawings.

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner made it a deliberate practice to draw every day in order to capture as many impressions of his surroundings as possible - be it landscapes, cityscapes, the human form, or animals.

Most of Kirchner's sketches were done with pencil or chalk and executed directly, and often hastily, onto the paper of the sketchbook. Thus, the tipped-in miniature drawings of the Apocalypse series are exceptional, and invite thoughts about Kirchner's reasoning in their case. At the time of their creation, the artist, obviously did not have readily to hand a sketchbook, which he usually carried around with him wherever he went. From his letters, we know of two instances when Kirchner had no access to artist's materials. The first time was when he was admitted to the Sanatorium Binswanger in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland, where he sought treatment for his severe physical and mental problems in 1917. The second instance was at the time of Kirchner's initial arrival in the mountains of Davos, Switzerland, later in 1917, where he hoped to escape the war and enlistment as a soldier. His decision to use discarded packages from various brands of cigarettes instead of a sketchbook or at least paper seems to indicate that the drawings were created during one of those two periods. It also hints at the great urgency with which Kirchner visualized his interpretation of the Apocalypse, which did not allow him to wait until he could obtain proper materials.

Another aspect that should be taken into account regarding Kirchner's Apocalypse works is the periodical paralysis of his limbs, which, if one believes Kirchner's complaints during the war, happened frequently and fiercely. Even though Kirchner is known to have exaggerated his condition in many instances, consideration of his handwriting during and after the war, which is scrawly and often uncontrolled, attests to a considerable impairment of his motor skills.

In any case, it is also the album itself that stands in contrast to others that have survived. Kirchner usually used the same type of sketchbooks, which, during his time in Davos, he always bought at the same store in town. The particular kind of binding of the GRI's Apocalypse album suggests a later assembly of the drawings and a retrospective binding, which, judging from the style of the inner parts of the covers, dates to the 1920s. The binding was most likely done in Paris, a fact that is revealed by a small imprint on the inside of the album's cover, which reads _Lucie Weill_, the name of a gallery and publisher based in Paris at that time.

In addition, the sequence of the drawings as pasted into the album is non-chronological and does not correspond to the biblical narrative. It is, however, as handwritten numbers on the back of the single works indicate, deliberate. But was Kirchner himself responsible for the arrangement of the works, their pasting, and the binding of the album? Considering Kirchner's revived interest in the Apocalypse in 1935 (see also Thomas W. Gaehtgens and Anja Foerschner, "Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's Drawings of the Apocalypse," _Getty Research Journal_ no. 6.), which was sparked by his ambitions to embellish a little chapel in his adopted home, Davos, this scenario seems likely. It is possible that, in 1935, when he approached the church with his plans, he assembled his drawings in a representative way in order to present them to the person in charge. A drawing from a sketchbook from 1935 detail the artist's idea about the mural. Like many of these large-scale endeavors, however, this undertaking was never realized and no documents exist in the parish that would provide more information. It might well be that an official assignment for the mural never happened and it was only a wish by the artist for whom such a large-scale work would have been a major achievement. Indeed, throughout his career, Kirchner aspired to execute murals (e.g., in the 1912 chapel of the Sonderbund exhibition, or the embellishment of the Folkwang Museum in Essen from 1927 on).
