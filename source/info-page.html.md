_Kirchner in the army_, 1915


The Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Project is a research project focuses on an album by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, which contains twelve drawings of the Apocalypse. 1917, to which the artist dated this album, was not only a time of physical and psychological crises for Kirchner, but also a time of general anxiety in the face of the horrors of the First World War. Taking this album as a starting point, the Scholar’s Workspace offers the opportunity to place it into its historical and philosophical context and examine topics like Ernst Ludwig Kirchner’s life and art around 1917, social and philosophical developments in the early 20th century, art and the First World War, or the Apocalypse in art.
